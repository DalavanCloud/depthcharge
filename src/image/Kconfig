config LDSCRIPT_ARCH
	bool "Architecture specific linker script"
	default n
	help

	  the architecture specific linker script provided from libpayload.
	  Otherwise, the default src/image/depthchearge.ldscript is used.

config KERNEL_START
	hex "Physical address of the region the kernel image is loaded into"
	default 0x100000
	help
	  The start of a region of memory the kernel image is loaded into from
	  the boot medium (vboot, network, etc.). This image may or may not be
	  a wrapper around the actual kernel code (e.g. FIT) and may or may not
	  require further decompression or relocation.

config KERNEL_SIZE
	hex "The size of the region the kernel image is loaded into"
	default 0x10000000 if FASTBOOT_MODE
	default 0x2000000
	help
	  The size of the memory region described in KERNEL_START.

config BASE_ADDRESS
	hex "The address depthcharge is linked to run at"
	default 0x2000000
	help
	  The address that the main part of depthcharge runs at. That includes
	  everything except the code which pivots between the read only and
	  read/write firmware which is linked to run from the region of memory
	  the kernel is eventually loaded into.

config HEAP_SIZE
	hex "The size of the heap in bytes"
	default 0x200000
	help
	  The size of the heap in bytes, minus any padding needed to align it
	  to a 16 byte boundary.

config STACK_SIZE
	hex "The size of the stack in bytes"
	default 0x4000
	help
	  The size of the stack in bytes, minus any padding needed to align it

	default 0x100000
	help
	  The size of the area the GBB is loaded into during the RO portion of
	  the boot which is referred to later by vboot in both RO and RW.
